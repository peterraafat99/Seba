# Chatbot Scope Management - Changes Summary

## Problem
The chatbot was using RAG search to answer questions from **all lessons** without indicating that topics were outside the current lesson scope.

## Solution
Implemented a **hybrid approach** that:
1. Prioritizes current lesson content
2. Can answer questions from other lessons **with clear disclaimers**
3. Cites the source lesson when using external content

## Changes Made

### 1. **Re-enabled RAG Search with Scope Awareness** (`chatbot.py` lines ~175-210)
   - **Restored:** `KnowledgeBase` search across all lessons in the vector database
   - **Added:** Automatic detection of whether RAG content is from current lesson or external
   - **Marked:** External references with "(OUT OF CURRENT SCOPE)" label

### 2. **Updated Prompt Instructions** (`chatbot.py` lines ~236-258)
   - **Primary Focus:** Always prioritize content from the current lesson
   - **Out-of-Scope Handling:** If answering from other lessons, MUST include disclaimer:
     ```
     ⚠️ **Note:** This topic is covered in [Lesson Name], not in our current lesson.
     Here's what you need to know:
     [Answer from that lesson]
     ```
   - **Citations:** Must cite source lesson: [Term 1 Les5], [Term 2 Les 9], etc.
   - **Unknown Topics:** Politely decline if not in curriculum

### 3. **Smart Greeting Handler** (`chatbot.py` lines ~146-156)
   - Fast response for simple greetings without AI processing
   - Mentions the current lesson title in the greeting

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Current Lesson Questions:
**User on "Term 1 Les1":** "What are irrational numbers?"
**Bot:** [Direct answer from Term 1 Les1 content, no disclaimer]

### ✅ Other Lesson Questions (With Disclaimer):
**User on "Term 1 Les1":** "When will we study right angle triangles?"
**Bot:** 
```
⚠️ **Note:** This topic is covered in Term 2 Les 21 (Projections), not in our current 
lesson (Term 1 Les1). Here's what you need to know:

Right angle triangles are studied in the context of projections, where you learn about...
[Term 2 Les 21]
```

### ✅ Unknown Topics:
**User:** "What is calculus?"
**Bot:** "That's a great question! However, I don't have information about that topic in our current Math Grade 8 curriculum..."
